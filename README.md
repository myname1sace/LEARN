### 🚴‍♀️ Bike Sales Dashboard 📊

This repository contains a **Bike Sales Data Analysis and Dashboard** project, created to explore customer demographics and purchasing behavior. The project involves data cleaning, analysis, and building an interactive dashboard to uncover key insights for a business audience.

### 📘 Dataset Overview

The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, contains information about bike sales, including customer demographics and purchase history. It has approximately **1,027 rows and 13 columns**, with key columns like `Marital Status`, `Gender`, `Income`, `Education`, `Region`, `Age`, `Commute Distance`, and `Purchased Bike`.

### ❓ Research Questions

The analysis aims to answer the following questions to help the business understand its customer base and optimize sales strategies:

  * Does gender influence the likelihood of purchasing a bike?
  * How does income level relate to bike purchases?
  * Does marital status affect bike purchasing behavior?
  * Which region has the highest number of bike buyers?
  * What is the average age of bike buyers compared to non-buyers?
  * How does commute distance influence bike purchasing decisions?

### 🧼 Data Cleaning & Preparation

The raw dataset required several cleaning and preparation steps to ensure accuracy and usability:

  * **Removed duplicate rows** to ensure each entry is unique.
  * **Standardized categorical values** (e.g., `M` and `S` were replaced with `Married` and `Single`, `F` and `M` with `Female` and `Male`).
  * **Formatted columns** to the correct data types, such as converting `Income` to currency.
  * **Created a new Age Brackets column** to categorize customers into `Adolescent`, `Middle Age`, and `Old` groups for easier analysis.

### 📈 Interactive Dashboard

The final output is an interactive dashboard built with a Microsoft Excel or similar spreadsheet software. It provides dynamic visualizations and filters to explore the data in detail. The dashboard includes charts showing `Average Income vs. Purchase`, `Customer Age Brackets`, and `Customer Commute` patterns, allowing users to filter by `Marital Status`, `Region`, `Education`, and `Occupation`.
